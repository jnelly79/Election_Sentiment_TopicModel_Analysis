# Election Sentiment Topic Model Analysis

## Synoposis
After watching a netflix documenary about how the U.S. is politically polarized like never before I wanted to do a small research project to discover if this is true. This research project will utilize a twitter developer account to stream tweets in real time into a MongoDB database collection for analysis later. This research project will contain methods on how to extract the data from MongoDB, preprocess the tweets/data, clean the data, normalize the data, explore the data, analyze the data with textual analytics (sentiment analysis and topic modeling) and visualize the data.

Code execution process.
1.   Execute election_scrape.py after modifiying it in the main directory. 
2.   Execute data_prep.py n the main directory.
3.   Execute data_text_normalize.py to clean/process the data n the main directory.
4.   Execute data_clusterin.py in the main directory.
5.   Execute afinn_sentiment.py in the main directory.
6.   Execute vader_sentiment.py in the main directory.
7.   Execute data_combiner.py in the main directory.
8.   Execute unsupervised_sentiment_topic_model.py in the main directory.
