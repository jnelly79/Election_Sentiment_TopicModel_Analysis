# Election Sentiment Topic Model Analysis

## Synoposis
After watching a netflix documenary about how the U.S. is politically polarized like never before I wanted to do a small research project to discover if this is true. This research project will utilize a twitter developer account to stream tweets in real time into a MongoDB database collection for analysis later. This research project will contain methods on how to extract the data from MongoDB, preprocess the tweets/data, clean the data, normalize the data, explore the data, analyze the data with textual analytics (sentiment analysis and topic modeling) and visualize the data.
